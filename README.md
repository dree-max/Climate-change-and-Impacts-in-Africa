# Climate Change and Impacts in Africa

Welcome to the **Climate Change and Impacts in Africa** project repository. This project is dedicated to understanding and addressing the critical issue of climate change in the African continent.

## Project Overview

Climate change, as defined by the United Nations, refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. While natural factors like changes in the sun's activity or volcanic eruptions can influence climate, human activities since the 1800s have become the predominant driver of climate change. The burning of fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and gas, has led to increased greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in profound and wide-ranging consequences.

In this project, we aim to report on the state of climate change in Africa at the upcoming African Union Summit. As part of our mission, we will:

- **Data Cleaning**: Rigorously clean and preprocess the IEA-EDGAR CO2 dataset to ensure its accuracy and usability.

- **Data Integration**: Combine relevant datasets and sources to enhance our understanding of the climate situation in Africa.

- **Data Analysis**: Utilize advanced data analysis techniques to extract valuable insights and trends from the data to present a comprehensive view of the state of climate change in Africa.

- **Regional Impact Assessment**: Conduct a regional impact assessment, selecting one country from each African region as a case study. This will enable us to provide insights into the specific effects of climate change in these areas.

- **Reporting**: Compile our findings into a detailed report that will be presented at the African Union Summit, highlighting the critical issues and challenges associated with climate change in Africa.
