## Overview

A comprehensive data analysis project examining climate change patterns and impacts across the African continent, developed to support evidence-based policy decisions at the African Union Summit. This project leverages the IEA-EDGAR CO2 emissions dataset to provide actionable insights into regional climate trends and their socio-economic implications.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Process and analyze IEA-EDGAR CO2 emissions data to identify climate trends across African regions
- **Regional Impact Assessment**: Conduct detailed case studies representing each African sub-region to understand localized climate impacts
- **Policy-Ready Reporting**: Generate executive summaries and visualizations suitable for high-level policy discussions
- **Data-Driven Recommendations**: Provide evidence-based insights to support climate adaptation and mitigation strategies

## 📊 Key Findings

### Continental Emissions Trends
Our analysis reveals significant variations in CO2 emissions patterns across African regions, with notable increases in industrial emissions correlating with economic development trajectories.

### Regional Case Studies
Through our representative country analysis, we identified distinct climate impact patterns:
- **West Africa**: Increasing desertification pressures affecting agricultural productivity
- **East Africa**: Variable precipitation patterns impacting water security
- **Southern Africa**: Industrial emissions growth coupled with renewable energy potential
- **Central Africa**: Deforestation-related emissions alongside conservation opportunities
- **North Africa**: Urban heat island effects and energy transition challenges

### Policy Implications
The data indicates urgent need for:
- Enhanced regional cooperation on emissions monitoring
- Targeted adaptation funding for vulnerable communities
- Technology transfer initiatives for clean energy adoption
- Strengthened climate data infrastructure across the continent
